# Final Project - Soccer Shooting Game

## **Project Overview**
For my final project, I intend to create an interactive soccer shooting game. The player will click to aim the ball, and the goalkeeper will randomly dive to a spot to block or let the ball pass. I will load models for a soccer ball, a stadium, and a goalkeeper using Three.js. The soccer ball will be animated with simple movements, and the goalkeeper will have an animation for diving. Additionally, lighting will be used to create a realistic environment, and the entire scene will be rendered in Three.js using JavaScript.

## **Project Schedule**

**Week 1:**  
- Research and find 3D models for a soccer ball, stadium, and goalkeeper.  
- Set up the Three.js environment and basic scene with a camera and lighting.

**Week 2:**  
- Load the models into the Three.js scene.  
- Position the soccer ball, goalkeeper, and stadium in the scene.  
- Implement basic shooting mechanics for the soccer ball.

**Week 3:**  
- Add goalkeeper animation (dive) and randomization for positioning.  
- Integrate the player's interaction (click to aim and shoot).  
- Fine-tune lighting and textures to improve visual quality.

**Week 4:**  
- Polish the game mechanics and animations.  
- Implement game logic (scoring, goal detection).  
- Prepare for final presentation and submit the project.

## **Project Technical Requirements**
- **Technologies Used:** Three.js, JavaScript  
- **Models:** Soccer ball, stadium, and goalkeeper (in formats such as OBJ or GLTF)  
- **Animation:** Simple animations for ball movement and goalkeeper dive.  
- **Lighting:** Use of ambient and point lights for realism.  
- **Features:** Interactive shooting, goalkeeper AI, and a visually engaging stadium environment.
